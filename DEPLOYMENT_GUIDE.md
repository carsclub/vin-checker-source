# VIN Checker Deployment Guide

## GitHub Build Issues - SOLVED

### Problem
The `npm run build` command was failing on GitHub due to missing security environment variables required by the production build.

### Solution
Created a CI-specific build script that provides fallback environment variables for GitHub Actions while maintaining security for production deployment.

## Build Process

### Local Development Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### CI/GitHub Build
```bash
./scripts/build-ci.sh
```

The CI build script automatically:
- Sets fallback environment variables for CI
- Runs TypeScript checking
- Builds frontend with Vite
- Bundles backend with ESBuild

## GitHub Actions Configuration

The repository now includes `.github/workflows/build.yml` that:
- Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Uses CI-safe environment variables
- Uploads build artifacts
- Runs on every push to main/master branches

## Environment Variables

### Production Deployment (Replit)
Required in Account Secrets:
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 32-byte hex string for data encryption
- `HMAC_SECRET`: Secret for API signature validation  
- `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY`: Admin authentication key

### CI Builds (GitHub Actions)
Uses fallback values automatically - no secrets needed for build testing.

## Deployment Status

✅ **Local Build**: Working  
✅ **GitHub CI Build**: Working  
✅ **Replit Production**: Ready with Account Secrets configured  
✅ **All Core Functions**: VIN API, Stripe payments, email notifications tested

## Quick Start

1. Push code to GitHub - builds will pass automatically
2. Deploy on Replit with Account Secrets configured
3. Application will start with full security protection

Your VIN Checker application is now ready for production deployment!
