# Payment Issue Debugging Guide

## Issue: Payment Deducted but No Results Page Access

### What Happened:
1. User initiated payment for $0.75 USD
2. Payment was successfully processed by Stripe (money deducted)
3. User did not reach the payment success page or got an "unexpected error"
4. Redirect to car history results failed

### Root Cause Analysis:
The issue is likely in the Stripe redirect flow. When Stripe processes a payment, it should redirect back to:
`/payment-success?vin=VIN_NUMBER&payment_intent=pi_XXX&redirect_status=succeeded`

### Temporary Fix Implemented:
1. Added better debugging logs to PaymentSuccess.tsx
2. Added "Access Report Anyway" button on error page
3. Improved error messaging with VIN display
4. Added payment verification with backend API

### For User Testing:
If payment is deducted but you can't access results:
1. Note down your VIN number
2. Click "Access Report Anyway" button
3. Or manually navigate to: `/car-history-results?vin=YOUR_VIN&paid=true`

### Next Steps:
1. Check browser console logs during payment
2. Verify Stripe webhook configuration
3. Consider switching to server-side payment confirmation
4. Add payment recovery mechanism

### Payment Amount:
Currently set to $0.75 USD (75 cents) for testing
Will be changed back to $20 USD after testing is complete
